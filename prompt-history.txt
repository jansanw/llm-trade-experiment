Write a bot that will use deepseek's LLM api (with a wrapper to make it easy to swap for openai or claude, or a locally running deepseek instance). It will pass in the past 100 hourly candles with OLHC information, and the past 100 15 min candles, 5min candles, and 1 min candles. It will ask the agent whether to go long or short, and respond with a confidence. We'll also need a ui to visualize this with market data displayed along with the response we got for that particular minute. We'll also need a system to backtest with historical data, hitting the api as though it were live. This system will primarily be used on MNQ futures, but may be extended for crypto or SPY etc. The trades will be expected to be on the order of minutes to hours, always within a single day.
